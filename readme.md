# The Pinecone Programming Language
**_Built from the ground up to be fast, concise and intuitive._**

## NOTE: PINECONE IS NO LONGER BEING ACTIVELY DEVELOPED OR MAINTAINED ## 

Pinecone is a new programming language. Its goal is to combine the simplicity of a dynamic language with the performance of a compiled one. It is under rapid development, but most of the core features are ready.

__If you want to program in Pinecone now, see the [tutorials](tutorials/index.md) for how to get started.__

__There is also a Pinecone plugin for VIM [here](https://github.com/wsKilljoy/vim-pinecone).__

## About
Pinecone is a brand new, easy to learn, general purpose, multi-paradigm, high performance programming language created by William W Wold. Work on the language began on October 4th, 2016. Pinecone can now be interpreted or transpiled to C++. The language is written from scratch (it includes an integrated lexer, parser and interpreter, etc.).

## Example
Here is the common demo program FizzBuzz written in Pinecone. It prints the numbers from 1 to 20, but it prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it is divisable by 5 and "FizzBuzz" if it is divisible by both. You can find more samples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/william01110111/Pinecone/tree/master/examples) or the [tutorials](https://github.com/william01110111/Pinecone/tree/master/tutorials).

```
# FizzBuzz

# call the function defined below
fizzBuzz: 1, 20

# define the FizzBuzz function
fizzBuzz :: {start: Int, end: Int}: (

	# loop i from start to end
	i: in.start | i <= in.end | i: i+1 @ (

		# use conditionals to print the right thing

		i % 3 = 0 && i % 5 = 0 ?
			print: "FizzBuzz"
		|
		i % 3 = 0 ?
			print: "Fizz"
		|
		i % 5 = 0 ?
			print: "Buzz"
		|
			print: i
	)
)
```

## Why?
This is probably the most common reaction to hearing about a new language. I realize that there are a __lot__ of programming languages, and that the reason for that is that there are so many assholes like me who keep making them. I do truly think, though, that Pinecone fills a previously empty niche.

Pinecone aims to have similar capabilities to modern object oriented compiled languages such as C++, Swift and Rust. It's primary attraction is the simplicity and consistency of it's syntax. Here are some examples of how Pinecone is different from other popular languages:

* Variable creation is implicit, just set a variable and it is created.
* Variables are statically typed, but type deduction is automatic.
* Calling a function that takes no arguments is the same syntax as accessing a variable (just writing it's name).
* Calling a function that takes one argument is the same syntax as setting or creating a variable (`funcOrVar: input`).
* Calling a function that takes multiple arguments is the same syntax as setting or creating a tuple (`funcOrTuple: input1, input2`).
* White space is ignored _and_ semicolons are not necessary
* `:` is used for assignment, which leaves `=` free for comparison, rather than the often confusing `==`.
* Tuples, structs and classes are all basically the same thing
* Functions can be sent arguments from the left side, right side or both (`inputLeft.function: inputRight`), which is used for class methods but can also allow you to define functions for any type (even primitive).
* Program control is done with operators instead of keywords (`?` instead of `if`)

## Compatibility
Pinecone currently requires zero external dependencies (and the only one that will likely be added is LLVM). You will need a C++11 compiler to build it, and the process is easier with GCC and Make. Pinecone has been successfully tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

## Current State
The features that are currently implemented are as follows:

* Primitive data types `Bool`, `Int` and `Dub`
* All the operators you would expect (`+`, `*`, `%`, `:`, `=`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `&&`, etc.)
* Single and multi line comments
* Flow control (if, if/else, while loop, for loop)
* Constants
* Data structs
* Tuples
* Int arrays
* Functions
* Strings and various String operations
* User input
* Running system commands
* Interpreter for rapid development and simplicity
* Transpiler to C++ for max performance

The following features are coming soon:

* Whatev type (equivalent to templates or generics in other languages)
* Arrays of any type (Whatev support needed)
* Pass-by-reference
* Proper classes (pass-by-reference needed)
* Operator overloading

## Contributing
I have not yet added enough documentation to the language internals to make it practical for others to contribute to the language itself. If you are interested in adding a specific feature or just helping out, post in the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PineconeLang/) or direct message me on [reddit](www.reddit.com/u/william01110111/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/PineconeLang). Fixes and improvements to the readmes and tutorials are always welcome.
